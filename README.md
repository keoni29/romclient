# Romclient
Romclient is a utility for creating backups of atari2600 games on your PC for preservation purposes or for playing your games on an emulator.
This software is used with a cartridge reader I developed. The firmware for this cartreader can be found at https://github.com/keoni29/vcsreaderfw
